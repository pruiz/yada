yada - yet another database abstraction
================================================================================

Yada is a c library that abstracts SQL databases aiming at allowing transparent
use of multiple databases.  The goal in mind is to make a common interface to
multiple databases, thus stopping the need for application developers to write
different modules for each SQL backend they want to support.  It's also useful
for caching data in different database types, for example, accessing a remote
Oracle database and caching results in a local MySQL one (the original proof of
concept did so).

To accomplish this, it uses a compatability layer of functions to bind input
and output variables, prepare statements, and retreive data. Functionality and
concept are somewhat like perl's DBI, and somewhat improved (I hope). In fact,
I use it on projects where I have no need for multiple database support because
I like the API.

This API seems to work well, but I want to wait a bit longer before going to
version 1.0 and locking it in to make sure there aren't any last minute changes
or oversights.

I know the documentation is sparse for now, I'm working on it ... please don't
hesitate to email me with questions and I'll be happy to help.  That will also
help me to know which parts need better documentation.

See README.modules for module status.

Please send any comments and bugs to yada@devit.com.
