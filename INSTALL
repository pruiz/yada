yada build instructions
================================================================================

./configure with options you want

Some notable ones are:

--enable-debug
Compiles with -g and enables debugging messages written to stderr.
To just compile with -g, set the environment variable CFLAGS
accordingly.

--enable-ltdl-install
Force the installation of the bundled libltdl


Configuring for different database types
================================================================================

  --with-<db_type>[=DIR]
  --with-<db_type>-incdir=DIR
  --with-<db_type>-libdir=DIR

There are a few options for defining the proper locations for database
libraries. --with-<db_type> will search commong default locations, this is the
default.  If you set --with-<db_type>=DIR it will look in DIR/include and
DIR/lib for headers and libraries respectively.  To get more specific, you may
use --with-<db_type>-incdir=DIR --with-<db_type>-libdir=DIR to set each of the
directories where the files can be found.

Currently supported database types:

--with[out]-mysql

--with[out]-oracle

--with[out]-pgsql

--with[out]-sqlite3

When configure is done, to install simply:

make
make install


Tested platforms
================================================================================

As of right now, yada requires gmake to build.  I've tested on
gcc-x86-linux, gcc-x86-solaris, gcc-sparc-solaris, suncc-sparc-solaris,
gcc-x86-freebsd, and it seems to work fine.  Please let me know
<yada@devit.com> if you experience problems with any builds, or if it
works on anything else.
